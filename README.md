# Examining the Relationship Between Food Insecurity and Obesity in Georgia, by County.
## About
Obesity and food insecurity are both public health concerns that have influences at the individual and environmental levels. Approximately one in three US adults are obese, and are at increased risk of negative health consequences, including premature death, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.

 We observe the relationship of Georgians with access to healthy foods and the prevalence of obesity by county. In the projections provided we observe that in areas with increased access to healthy foods (greater Atlanta region) the prevalence of obesity declines. In several areas with decreased access to healthy foods (central and southern Georgia) the prevalence of obesity increases
